            <p>Hi, my name is Muhammad Bilal Ramzan. I am from Silver Spring, Maryland. I have been working as a Software Quality Analyst for the past 3 years and now I have decided to pursue a different career in IT, to become a Full Stack Developer. 
                <br>
                Currently, I am attending George Washington University Coding Boot Camp to become a Full Stack developer. Ever since I started working as a software quality analyst I always wondered how these applications are built and how they interact with different systems, so I started learning about development on my own and the more I learned the more it piqued my interest.
            </p>
